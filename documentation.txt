Setting up Flask Authentication Project

Step 1: Create Virtual Environment

    # Create a virtual environment
    python3 -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate

    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

Step 2: Install Requirements

    # Make sure you are in the project directory and your virtual environment is activated
    # Install required Python packages
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Migrate Database

    # Initialize the database migration
    python3 manage.py makemigrations
    python3 manage.py makemigrations extraction (optional --> when migrations are not reflect in database)

    # Apply migrations
    python3 manage.py migrate

    # create superuser
    python3 manage.py createsuperuser

Step 5: Install packages from requirements.txt
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Step 5: Run django server

    # This command is user for run django server
    python3 manage.py runserver

    Also run celery parallel in new tab:-

    # This command is user for run celery worker
    celery -A text_extraction_service worker --loglevel=inf

    #This command is use for run celery beat
    celery -A text_extraction_service beat --loglevel=inf

This all steps use for run application Locally.




Now this steps is use for run application using docker

Step 1:
    #If you want to run only with Docker file then Hit command:-

    docker build -t text_extraction_service .
    docker run -d -p 8000:8000 extraction

    #If you want to Run Using Docker Compose then hit this command:

    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up
